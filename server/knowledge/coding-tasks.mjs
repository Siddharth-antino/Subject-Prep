    question: 'Machine coding: Searchable React Native contact list',
    promptCode:
      '**Timebox:** 25 minutes. Build a React Native screen with a TextInput and a FlatList of local contacts. Search by name, show a useful empty state, and allow selecting a contact.\n\n**Acceptance checks:**\n- Use stable IDs for row keys.\n- Changing the query updates the list; clearing it restores all contacts.\n- Selection updates the correct row without mutating the contact data.\n- Input and selectable rows have useful accessibility labels.\n\nStart with local data; networking, persistence, and navigation are optional follow-ups only if time remains.',
    answer:
      'Separate query and selected contact ID from source data. Derive the filtered list; do not mutate contacts. Use stable keyExtractor IDs and pass selection-dependent state to FlatList when row rendering depends on it. Keep row updates understandable before adding memoization. Test empty query, no matches, case-insensitive matching, and selecting a row after filtering.',
